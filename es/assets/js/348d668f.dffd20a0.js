Such is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields  – each of these fields will have one additional data field in addition to  the one presented in the context of deal fields. \\nFor example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on  the account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field,  and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. \\nTo find out which data fields are available, fetch one deal and list its keys.\\n"},{"name":"Deals","description":"Deals represent ongoing, lost or won sales to an organization or to a person. \\nEach deal has a monetary value and must be placed in a stage.\\nDeals can be owned by a user.\\nEach deal consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. \\nThe custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys. \\nThese hashes can be mapped against `DealField.key`. \\nThe corresponding label for each such custom field can be obtained from `DealField.name`.\\n"},{"name":"Filters","description":"Each filter is essentially a set of data validation conditions. \\nA filter of the same kind can be applied when fetching a list of deals, persons, organizations or products in the context of a pipeline. \\nFilters are limited to a maximum of 16 conditions. \\nWhen applied, only items matching the conditions of the filter are returned. \\nDetailed definitions of filter conditions and additional functionality is not yet available.\\n"},{"name":"ItemSearch","description":"Ordered reference objects, pointing to either deals, persons, organizations, or products.\\n"},{"name":"OrganizationFields","description":"Organization fields represent the near-complete schema for an organization in the context of the company of the authorized user. \\nEach company can have a different schema for their organizations,  with various custom fields. \\nIn the context of using organization fields as a schema for defining the data  fields of an organization, it must be kept in mind that some types of custom  fields can have additional data fields which are not separate organization  fields per se. \\nSuch is the case with monetary, daterange and timerange fields - each of these  fields will have one additional data field in addition to the one presented  in the context of organization fields. \\nFor example, if there is a monetary field with the key `ffk9s9` stored on the  account, `ffk9s9` would hold the numeric value of the field,  and `ffk9s9_currency` would hold the ISO currency code that goes along with the numeric value. \\nTo find out which data fields are available, fetch one organization  and list its keys.\\n"},{"name":"OrganizationRelationships","description":"Organization relationships represent how different organizations are related to each other. \\nThe relationship can be hierarchical (parent-child companies) or lateral as defined by the `type` field - either `parent` or `related`.\\n","deprecated":true},{"name":"Organizations","description":"Organizations are companies and other kinds of organizations you are making deals with.
